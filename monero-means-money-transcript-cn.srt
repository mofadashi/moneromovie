1
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,210
我是丹尼尔-金

2
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,810
我来自美国波士顿

3
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,830
我是一个全职数字货币顾问

4
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,870
我是连接两个世界的桥梁

5
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:31,590
一个是非营利，传统的，开源的

6
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,370
非商业性质的，基层自发的数字货币

7
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,850
另一个是传统的金融世界

8
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:42,970
包含了机构投资者，信托和

9
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,350
对数字货币感兴趣的人

10
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,790
这些人需要来自跟他们站在同一立场，

11
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,910
了解他们的专业人士的帮助

12
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:58,190
我之前的职位是股票对冲基金研究主管

13
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:02,710
我们管理者价值一亿美元的股票市场

14
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:06,210
我做了几年之后辞职单干

15
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,970
因为我觉得

16
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,930
人的一生

17
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,670
仅有几次能从根本上

18
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,610
突破自己的重要机会

19
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,950
我是一个博士生

20
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,810
在互联网泡沫期间攻读哈佛大学的博士

21
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,130
我记得当时我想的是

22
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,570
“谷歌，哇哦！”

23
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,450
“当时的人们都考虑要投资谷歌”

24
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,730
我觉得

25
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,550
投资一个只有20多个网站的谷歌

26
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:45,310
是个挺愚蠢的决定

27
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,490
为什么非要用谷歌搜索呢 --

28
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:51,110
一共也就20多个网站

29
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,770
你早就知道这些网站了，

30
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,630
值得一看的网站也就是

31
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:01,370
你收藏夹里的那20几个了

32
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,870
这是非常错误的想法

33
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:09,470
当比特币跟数据块链出现的时候

34
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:12,190
在认真考虑

35
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,690
学习了一段时间之后

36
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,910
我决定把所有时间投入进来

37
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,110
下面我想谈一下由中央银行控制的

38
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,470
法定通货

39
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,450
与比特币

40
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,290
比特币是第一个数字货币

41
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,250
从比特币白皮书出现到现在已经11年了

42
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,450
2008年的万圣节

43
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:36,490
门罗币像是比特币的小弟弟一样

44
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,510
从出现到现在也有6年了

45
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,170
我今天的演讲由四个部分组成

46
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:45,230
探讨一下这三种货币

47
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,710
其中一点是稀缺性

48
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,370
毕竟

49
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,210
物以稀为贵

50
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,710
所以人们是如何解决

51
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,450
电子货币的稀缺性的呢？

52
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,370
在处理稀缺性上法定货币，

53
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,410
比特币跟门罗币使用的方法不同

54
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,250
接下来我要讨论一下可替代性和隐私

55
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,970
今年CDC

56
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,550
[重要分散集群] 的

57
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,610
座右铭是“尊重我的隐私”

58
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,070
我认为我不需要

59
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,410
努力说服在座各位

60
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,030
金融隐私有多重要

61
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,230
换一种说法更好理解--

62
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,910
监管状态

63
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:31,230
也就是每个人的金融交易都被追踪

64
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:34,130
监视与调查

65
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:38,950
这不是我们想要生活的社会

66
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,370
接下来是社区性

67
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,890
每一种货币

68
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,970
都需要社区

69
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,970
需要有一群人

70
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:47,970
相信

71
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,130
这个货币是有价值的钱

72
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,570
你如果没有社区

73
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,750
也就没有了钱

74
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,290
法定通货，比特币，门罗币的背后

75
00:04:55,290 --> 00:05:00,850
是由不同的社区支持的

76
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,770
最后是相关性

77
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,370
相关性这块

78
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,390
我要讲的是

79
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,930
CDC是一种

80
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,890
门罗币与其他加密经济群组

81
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,770
的合作

82
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,970
这次演讲

83
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:21,470
我内容着重点是

84
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,730
金融与经济

85
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,410
这又回到了对冲基金上

86
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:32,450
把法定通货，比特币与门罗比当作投资

87
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:37,610
稀缺性到底是何情况？我们为什么需要加密货币？

88
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:42,270
我们来看看我们每天使用的货币

89
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,030
这个是美元

90
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,110
人民币

91
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,110
欧元，瑞士法郎

92
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,410
我展示的是

93
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,270
来自政府官方的

94
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,210
货币流通数量的统计

95
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,830
这是M1

96
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,510
也就是纸币，货币

97
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:03,510
储蓄账户跟支票账户

98
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:06,830
所有一切现金

99
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,030
相关

100
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,430
图标上显示

101
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:14,530
自2008年十月份起，也就是比特币白皮书出世的时间

102
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:18,150
四个图表的左下角显示

103
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:23,850
这是2008年，这边是2019年底

104
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:28,290
你可以看到每个国家的

105
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,630
货币供应量的都有所膨胀

106
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,090
在短短的十一年内

107
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:37,030
美元的货币供应量上涨了2.6倍

108
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,130
换句话说，

109
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:43,490
印钞票的速度一直维持这个速度

110
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,790
我们之所以没注意到这个现象

111
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:48,950
是因为每年我们只能看到一点点的上涨

112
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:52,410
就好像是温水煮青蛙

113
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,610
青蛙不明白危险性

114
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,690
它一直待在温水里，发现后一切太迟了

115
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,130
已经被煮熟了

116
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,750
也就是

117
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,350
我们现在的状态

118
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:04,810
问题是

119
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:08,470
全球所有的法定通货

120
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:12,050
都在以令人不安的速度印着钞票

121
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,710
那什么是胜利呢？

122
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:17,030
国家货币怎样发展才算是

123
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:20,790
明智的呢？

124
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:25,230
肯定是要比其他国家膨胀的速度要慢才好

125
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,450
我们有如下问题

126
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,450
如果你缩小了看

127
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,530
美元的走势

128
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,910
近五十年的变化

129
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:37,310
你会看到呈指数增长的曲线

130
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:41,910
这是所有储户所面临的问题 --

131
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:44,090
每个有存款的人

132
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:47,630
都要面对的趋势

133
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,810
我们的存款一直在被

134
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:53,050
新印出来的钱所稀释

135
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,770
2008年是中本聪出版白皮书的一年

136
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,730
也就是比特币的白皮书

137
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,750
这个白皮书的关键是

138
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,510
我不会讲很多

139
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,530
枯燥的知识点

140
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:10,290
我猜测在座各位智商至少140

141
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:11,990
对你们来说

142
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,750
读一下这个白皮书，学习一下

143
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,930
应该不会很难

144
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,110
我想说的是

145
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:22,850
诺贝尔经济学奖不能颁发给无名氏

146
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,910
但是中本聪

147
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,850
是绝对可以

148
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:31,230
获得诺贝尔经济学奖的

149
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:36,170
在稀缺性方面的经济学奖

150
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,410
中本聪所做的是

151
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,670
用合成法

152
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,170
创造出了数字的稀缺性

153
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,750
不需要中央集权

154
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:49,210
来维持这种稀缺性

155
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,550
在所有的国家货币中

156
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,610
欧洲中央银行

157
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,790
美国联邦储备

158
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:01,010
这些中央集权政府体

159
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,610
决定货币供应量

160
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,210
现在

161
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,450
宏观经济理论上来说

162
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:09,310
货币供应量是会根据

163
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:14,530
社会的经济来调节的

164
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:18,710
话句话说，如果社会生产力很强

165
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:23,930
社会货币供应量就会变得膨胀

166
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,250
现在的问题是

167
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,590
国家陷入麻烦

168
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,050
他们负债累累

169
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,970
国家给人民承诺的服务

170
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:35,470
因为太过昂贵而无法实现

171
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,790
他们负债累累

172
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,590
问题是

173
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:43,150
错误的管理打破了

174
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:46,590
货币投放量与基础经济规模之间

175
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,830
脆弱的平衡

176
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,590
为社么拥有一种

177
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,030
不受中央委员会控制的

178
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:59,190
货币很让人激动呢

179
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,330
是因为它

180
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:06,910
提供给人们多一种

181
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,830
退出法定货币的选择

182
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,810
也给也给中央银行

183
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,890
施加了压力

184
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:18,250
让他们在将来可以做得更好一些

185
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,810
也许

186
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,490
我们将来

187
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,450
会遭遇几次经济危机 --

188
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,050
或许我们不会

189
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:31,090
再经历一次2009年的经济危机了

190
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,250
中本聪共识在解决稀缺性上

191
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,510
采取了三种方式

192
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,890
在账户级别

193
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:39,790
换句话说

194
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:43,070
一个人的比特币

195
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,650
是如何跟另外一个人的区分开的呢？

196
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,730
当一个人

197
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:51,070
注册了比特币账户时

198
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,990
他们所做的其实是选择一个号码

199
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:56,670
从256位（2的256次方）中

200
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:59,450
选择号码

201
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,390
人们不擅长

202
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,310
想象出一个很大的数字

203
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:09,230
我们现在说的是从0到10*77

204
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,310
也就是数字1后边有77个零

205
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,050
这个数字到底有多大呢？

206
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:18,810
想象一下银河系的直径

207
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,810
把电子

208
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,410
一个挨一个的

209
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,490
排成队

210
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:27,650
这里用的是电子经典半径

211
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:33,450
把整个银河系的直径排满电子

212
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,590
还不够

213
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,590
你还要再找

214
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:41,110
一个银河系

215
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:45,310
再把电子一个挨一个的排列

216
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,830
哪怕这样也不够

217
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,330
你再找一个

218
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,330
像这样的礼堂

219
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,670
然后让细菌一个挨一个的排满

220
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,410
所有这些加起来才是10的77次方的大小

221
00:11:55,410 --> 00:12:00,650
你是从这么大的范围里随机挑选的数字

222
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:04,890
这也解释了为什么比特币的账户

223
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:08,410
不需要填写表格，也不需要征求账户许可

224
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,570
你只要选个数字

225
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,490
数字就是你的密匙

226
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,610
你需要保护它

227
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,330
因为只有拥有了密匙

228
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:21,630
你才可以使用个人的比特币

229
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,750
稀缺性的总水平是

230
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:28,050
我们如何知道在整个货币体系里到底有多比特币

231
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:31,110
以及有没有任何的损坏

232
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,050
稀缺性

233
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,590
是由一群网络矿工执行的

234
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,810
他们是一群很八卦的会计

235
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:45,310
从遵守一致规则中获利

236
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:49,010
最后一个问题，我们想要知道

237
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,490
谁给谁送了什么？

238
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,470
也就是区块链记录

239
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:55,530
区块链是一系列的块组成的

240
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:58,750
每个块包含了

241
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,010
一个人向另一个人交易的过程

242
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:03,430
谁像谁交易了多少钱

243
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:07,070
是每个块包含的内容

244
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,950
我们如何知道在此期间没有损坏呢？

245
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:12,490
众所周知，比特衰减

246
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,650
会造成损坏

247
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:17,450
也可能

248
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:23,670
有些对数据状态的错误操作

249
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,990
数据库是由

250
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:30,590
每个块里的矿工可改变的一小段数据段所维护的

251
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,070
也称作随机数

252
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:34,070
每个矿工

253
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:40,070
可以随机改变随机数，块的散列值低于一个数字

254
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,290
这叫做难点

255
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:44,350
通常情况下，当我们提到哈希函数时

256
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:47,550
我们不关心哈希函数的实际价值

257
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:50,690
我们只在乎哈希函数是否匹配

258
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:53,070
就好像我们检查文件完整性时

259
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:56,230
我们会把下载的文件的散列表

260
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,950
与你想找的文件的散列

261
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,690
表进行比较

262
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:04,030
在这种情况下，我们关心的是散列表的数字

263
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,190
数字的大小

264
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:11,950
难点是

265
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,670
数字必须满足每个块

266
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,250
换句话说，

267
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,390
每个块的散列表值要低于难点

268
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:21,330
用现实类比一下

269
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:23,970
想象一下你有一本会计账簿

270
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:29,470
每一页包含10分钟内发生的的交易

271
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,790
你要想办法

272
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:35,250
保证每一页交易的稀缺性

273
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,950
其中一种办法是

274
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:45,670
会计账簿的每一页质量要达到100万原子的寄倍数

275
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,110
每个会计师

276
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,790
会接触

277
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,890
修改这些纸张

278
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:56,870
在这个级别你可以增加或减少

279
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,570
万亿次的原子

280
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:01,010
纸的质量是一个随机数字

281
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:08,210
无论原子的数量是多少

282
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,370
很不容易

283
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,350
找到这样的一张纸

284
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,730
因为它是

285
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:18,690
包含了精确的一百万倍数的原子

286
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,370
而且是数字表象

287
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:23,410
你可以精准的复制它

288
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:26,170
现在你有了连锁的块

289
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:30,070
每一个快都有稀有属性

290
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:34,630
区块链把他们连接在一起

291
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,550
比特币与门罗币的稀有性 --

292
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,550
在于它们都有原代码库

293
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:43,510
在很多很多加密货币项目中

294
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:46,410
比特币很容易分离，修改

295
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,670
但门罗币不是这样的

296
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,930
门罗币是从头开始编写的

297
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,250
他们的椭圆曲线是不同的

298
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,670
这是一种技术性对冲形式

299
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:58,470
比特币的椭圆曲线值是secp256K1

300
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,730
而门罗币是 ed25519

301
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:07,010
我之前提到了比特币与门罗币都需要密匙

302
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:11,590
当我们要花加密货币的时候

303
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,030
我们需要一组数字，也就是密匙

304
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,490
比特币与门罗币都是这样的

305
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:18,290
不同点是

306
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,930
门罗币还有可视匙

307
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,210
这是另外一个密匙

308
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:27,370
是属于花费匙的一种

309
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,510
可视匙是用来解码

310
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:35,470
你个人区块链交易的

311
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,610
如果你有可视匙

312
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:41,310
你可以看到你涉及的区块链的交易

313
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:44,030
剩下的仍是加密的

314
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,770
地址空间也有所不同

315
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:51,170
比特币是10的60次方，门罗币是10的76次方

316
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:54,950
门罗币的地址空间更多

317
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,610
意味着如果你担心生日问题 --

318
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:00,010
生日问题是

319
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,010
假设有30个人

320
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:07,670
30个人中两个人生日是同一天的概率要比你想象的高很多

321
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:12,250
现在把这个问题扩展到随机选个数字

322
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,270
把它作为

323
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:18,710
加密账户，你会面临相同的问题

324
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,390
没办法保证

325
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:23,570
你随机选择的加密账户

326
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:26,730
不会被我选择了

327
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,530
这就是生日问题

328
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:33,950
如果我们有足够的空间，生日问题就不用过多担心

329
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:38,590
发行减缓是另一个比特币与门罗币之间的区别

330
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,270
比特币是阶梯式减缓

331
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:42,550
你可能听说过“减半”

332
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:45,470
比特币产量每四年

333
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:48,770
挖矿奖励就会减半

334
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:53,590
也就是在区块链里找到一页的奖励减半

335
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,870
每个矿工在他们的日历里

336
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:58,130
都有一个红色的日期

337
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,570
在那天，他们的收入减半

338
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,230
这就给

339
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:06,630
挖矿产业带来了很多不必要的戏剧性事件

340
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:12,630
门罗币采取的是逐渐减缓的方式

341
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,470
另一个不同点是

342
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:19,010
未来的货币发行量

343
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:23,210
比特币的奖励最后会趋近于0

344
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:29,470
他们预计用转账费用来弥补缺失

345
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:34,570
在门罗币，我们所关心的是：我们想要

346
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:38,930
矿工持续性地为系统工作

347
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,630
在门罗币里有一个叫做尾部发行

348
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:44,730
每个块永远都会有

349
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,570
0.6个门罗币

350
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:51,370
这笔钱是付给矿工的

351
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:54,710
来维持网络安全

352
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:58,470
长期的通货膨胀率是什么呢？

353
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,890
比特币基本上是0

354
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:06,830
关于比特币人们喜欢说，只会有2100百万的比特币被挖掘出来

355
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:09,570
人们很容易理解

356
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:14,170
门罗币是连续的线性增长--

357
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:18,750
但实际上并不是

358
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,270
像说的那样无限增长的

359
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:24,290
如果你仔细看门罗币的通货膨胀率

360
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:27,110
表面上是无限接近于0

361
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,790
如果你观察任何宏观经济理论

362
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:32,690
相关变量

363
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,610
是通货膨胀率

364
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,330
没人在意

365
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:41,430
名义上美元的数量会不会百亿增长

366
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,430
重要的是百分比

367
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:46,090
门罗币在这方面百分比很低

368
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:48,330
还在持续降低

369
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:51,010
这个曲线就是我刚才所说的 --

370
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:53,050
这些供给发行曲线显示

371
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:58,330
每种货币的存在数量与时间的函数关系

372
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:02,590
你可以看到门罗币开始时间较晚

373
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,490
有尾部增长

374
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:07,830
尾部增长有连续的线性斜率

375
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,490
造成斜率的原因是

376
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:16,250
新货币增长是给予矿工维护网络安全的奖励

377
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:21,090
然而在比特币上有一个悬而未决的问题

378
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:24,370
比特币的增长马上要达到2100万这个标记点

379
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,090
马上就达到0增加

380
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:30,110
有些文章提出

381
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:35,190
网络安全在那点会陷入危险

382
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,970
如果我们算一下这个的曲线导数--

383
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:43,450
我们对比一下去年，今年的供应增加了多少呢

384
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,250
换句话说，通货膨胀率是多少?

385
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,570
看这里

386
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,930
我在这里对比了几点不同

387
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,930
这个是金子的通货膨胀率

388
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,490
我们以为金子是不会通货膨胀的

389
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:57,310
不过因为有矿工--

390
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:00,570
这里说的是真正的矿工在挖掘土地

391
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:05,810
挖出金块，使世界的黄金总数增加

392
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:11,030
导致每年黄金的通货膨胀比例在1.5%左右

393
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:13,710
如果你把黄金当作货币的话

394
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:20,370
通货膨胀率不能高于1.5%

395
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:23,170
从比特币跟门罗币中我们可以看到

396
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:26,030
这个点状的蓝线显示现在

397
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:30,150
我们目前处在加密货币历史上一个很有趣的时间点

398
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:32,750
到目前为止

399
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:36,230
有很多的货币发行

400
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,950
为了发行这些货币

401
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:42,190
块的奖励非常高

402
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,550
我们现在面临新一种稀缺性

403
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:48,470
你看一下这个右边

404
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:54,270
事实上门罗币的通货膨胀率在未来的6年里

405
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:58,250
要比比特币的低（直到2025年）

406
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,410
有四年的时间他们膨胀率大概相同

407
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:04,670
从2029年起

408
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:09,030
比特币的通货膨胀率要低于门罗币

409
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:12,190
这里就有疑问了

410
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:17,390
矿工们如何通过维护网络得到报酬呢？

411
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:20,790
这个是中本聪共识中的重要特点

412
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:25,450
根据博弈论，所有的矿工会因为诚实而得到奖励

413
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:29,570
而不是因为贪婪而破坏游戏规则

414
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:34,190
因为挖矿工具导致的稀缺性是我们不想看到的

415
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:38,490
门罗币也有这方面的问题

416
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:43,110
在比特币的白皮书中，中本聪写到一个中央处理器一票

417
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:46,670
这也就意味着矿工得到的奖励

418
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:49,410
要与他们的付出成正比

419
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,750
也应该与矿工挖矿时的

420
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,650
花费成正比

421
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:58,910
话句话说，理论上矿工的花费与所得

422
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:03,390
应该是线性函数关系

423
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:07,430
不幸的是规模经济下硅的生产

424
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:09,450
破坏了线性关系

425
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:13,370
换句话说，如果你有2500万美金

426
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:17,230
花在新开的深圳的加工设施上

427
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:22,850
你可以自己做硅芯片

428
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,870
只用来做比特币的“工作量证明”

429
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:28,690
有专门的集成电路

430
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:32,430
已经用在网络与比特币上好几年了

431
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:39,050
现在来说比特币的挖掘基本上是被中国垄断了

432
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:44,390
这带来了集中性相关的担心

433
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:47,890
中国拥有所有的矿工并不需要担心

434
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:49,950
真正的问题是

435
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:52,590
这一个地区拥有全世界

436
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:57,590
几乎有所的比特币控制权

437
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:01,770
由于这个原因，出现了很多新闻

438
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:05,510
比如的中国与西方国家不断发展的贸易战

439
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,970
有一篇新闻文章说

440
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,930
中国政府近期颁布

441
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:15,950
在一年内实现

442
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,610
政府办公只能用中国的电脑硬件

443
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:21,690
在有限期内戴尔

444
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:25,690
或其他美国公司的电脑会被踢出中国市场

445
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:31,070
.同样的事情也发生在了中国比特币专用集成电路的加工厂

446
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:35,270
我们认为世界上的商品是自由流动的

447
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:40,670
如果只有一个地方不但控制整个世界的

448
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,730
所有加密散列的制造

449
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:47,070
而且因为贸易战的原因无法出口

450
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:54,070
在门罗币里，我们严肃的对待去中心化这个问题

451
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:57,690
我们对工作量证明进行了一些改动

452
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:00,190
来帮助采矿的这些人

453
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:02,670
That is, when Bitcoin started也就是当比特币被发明出来的时候

454
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:06,550
it was possible for just a regular person running

455
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:10,710
the Bitcoin client on their computer to actually have a shot

456
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,770
at getting a mining reward.

457
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:14,830
Those days are long gone because now

458
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:20,810
the hash power is dominated by these massive farms of ASICS.

459
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:25,530
It's just hopeless for any little guy to try to mine Bitcoin.

460
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,750
In Monero, we're trying to change that

461
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:31,090
and the proof of work has been modified several times.

462
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:34,730
Now, as of just last month,

463
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:37,030
the proof of work in Monero is now RandomX

464
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:40,930
which actually uses every single capability of a CPU

465
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,790
in doing the proof of work.

466
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:46,470
There's a basically a random program that gets executed.

467
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:51,550
Each core of the processor needs 2 gigabytes of RAM to run well.

468
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:56,150
This was a design decision made to

469
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:59,950
make it harder for botnets to control the network,

470
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:03,330
because if your computer is infected with a botnet

471
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:08,050
and 14 out of your 16 gigabytes of RAM are being eaten up,

472
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:10,190
you're probably going to notice it.

473
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:14,130
It was deliberate that design decision in RandomX to use a

474
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:19,810
high required amount of RAM for processing.

475
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,890
There's another source of scarcity

476
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:25,890
that is not necessarily one that you want in a blockchain,

477
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:28,070
and that is access to layer one.

478
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:32,430
Bitcoin's 1 megabyte block limit caused a project fork.

479
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:37,370
There was basically a civil war in Bitcoin over whether or not it was okay

480
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:41,350
to make blocks stay at this 1 megabyte limit.

481
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:44,690
It still rages on to this day. It's still a holy war

482
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:48,930
and this is something that Monero has avoided thus far.

483
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:52,330
Its solution to this is to use a adaptive block size

484
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:57,250
in which the maximum block size of a Monero block is flexible

485
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:02,410
and it can organically expand or shrink along with demand.

486
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:04,930
With, of course, provisions in there

487
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:09,490
to prevent the system from getting gamed.

488
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:13,370
And there's ongoing research to reduce the transaction size.

489
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,150
There's bulletproofs that went in recently

490
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:19,910
that reduce transaction sizes by a factor of 10, that went in.

491
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:26,450
And overnight the transaction fees for transacting Monero went down by a factor of 10

492
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:32,610
because the transaction fee is based on the kilobyte size of the transaction.

493
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:36,570
Moving on to fungibility and privacy.

494
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,830
Bitcoin is transparent.

495
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:43,790
If you are new to crypto you might be under the impression

496
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:46,990
that if you have Bitcoin you're anonymous.

497
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:49,250
It's this "anonymous magic internet money"

498
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,250
that you might have heard about.

499
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,250
Nothing could be further from the truth --

500
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:58,070
the popular press continues to push this misleading narrative.

501
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,050
Bitcoin is completely transparent

502
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:02,750
and if you read the Bitcoin white paper, it's all there.

503
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:08,630
It's specified that the sender, the receiver and how much got sent

504
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:14,010
is recorded in plaintext and recorded in the blockchain.

505
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:17,750
Which, because it has all this proof-of-work up behind it --

506
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:20,750
remember what I was saying about each transaction in the block

507
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:26,690
has a hash that makes it a very rare and unique set of data,

508
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:31,170
it's the multiple of 1 million atoms thing, right --

509
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:36,750
basically, these transparent details are written and etched into that blockchain forever.

510
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:40,350
There is no escaping that

511
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:45,290
it's completely incompatible, for example, with European privacy law, the GDPR.

512
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,310
Which has this "right to be forgotten"

513
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:50,510
that is totally non-existent in Bitcoin.

514
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:54,230
Once a transaction gets put into the Bitcoin blockchain it's there.

515
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:56,470
It's there forever.

516
00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:00,270
And the only thing that is not

517
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:03,590
totally transparent is that the Bitcoin address

518
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:07,490
is just a hex string - it's a string.

519
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:08,270
I mean,

520
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:10,250
when you come down to it, everything's a hex string --

521
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:15,550
but the Bitcoin address is a sequence of letters and numbers that looks anonymous.

522
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:20,030
But once that gets associated to your name and face,

523
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:22,270
that association, that metadata,

524
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:26,890
that marriage between a Bitcoin account number and your identity,

525
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,890
that doesn't change

526
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:32,190
because the blockchain is etched in stone forever.

527
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:34,070
And it's constantly growing.

528
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:38,930
The job of the people trying to identify and "dox" everyone

529
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,990
is - it's just a waiting game.

530
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,930
You have this blockchain every day.

531
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:44,930
You get some little piece of information:

532
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:51,490
"Oh, you know, Joe in Leipzig signed up with (an) exchange".

533
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:54,930
Now their identity information is associated with this.

534
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:57,750
Basically, this metadata just kind of

535
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:02,050
continues to gather on this blockchain until you have a situation

536
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,970
which is actually much worse than in Fiat.

537
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:11,790
When you have a Fiat bank account you do not expect that your bank is going to post your monthly statement

538
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:15,990
up on the bulletin board outside the bank for everybody to see.

539
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:19,670
But that is exactly the situation in Bitcoin

540
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:22,990
and it's not just the people out in your neighborhood who can see it.

541
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,830
It's everybody. Everybody in the world can see

542
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:29,470
who sent what to who and when.

543
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:34,670
The unfortunate consequence of this, is that

544
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:37,250
Bitcoins have a history behind them.

545
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:41,110
Remember that in Bitcoin, every Bitcoin in existence

546
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:44,810
first came into being as a reward that went to a miner.

547
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:50,250
Once the miner gets that Bitcoin and then they spend it, it starts circulating in the Bitcoin economy.

548
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:54,410
But because the blockchain is transparent, it's totally "see-through".

549
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:59,370
The entire history of every single Bitcoin now in existence can be traced back

550
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:03,330
to this person all the way back to when it was mined.

551
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:07,250
It's as if you have a 10 euro banknote

552
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:11,250
and on the back of that 10 euro banknote you see a nice list showing

553
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:14,910
everyone before you who owned that.

554
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:18,330
What could possibly be the negative consequences of this?

555
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:22,030
How about innocent people getting falsely accused

556
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:27,430
because they happen to have received money from somebody who unbeknownst to them

557
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:31,550
was involved in something that was not very good.

558
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,210
This is happening in Bitcoin.

559
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:38,450
There's a reputation in Bitcoin that transfers as well as value

560
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:42,350
and that is what is profoundly disturbing about having this.

561
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:44,270
And I call it a surveillance coin.

562
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:47,090
In a surveillance coin, it's not just value that transmits --

563
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:49,250
it's also reputation. Which means

564
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:51,970
if you're accepting money from somebody,

565
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:56,870
you're also accepting their life history.

566
00:31:56,870 --> 00:32:00,550
It's coming to you too. It's not just value.

567
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:03,490
In contrast, Monero is fungible.

568
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:06,650
Fungible just means that every unit of currency is

569
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:09,490
indistinguishable from the other units.

570
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:13,610
If I have 10 Monero, you have 10 Monero and then

571
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:18,470
we both trade the 10 Monero to other people, they still look like the 10 Monero.

572
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:22,550
There's no history. It works just like a cash bill.

573
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:25,890
It works just you think cash should work.

574
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:29,450
And it does this by adding three technologies

575
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:33,950
on top of what Bitcoin does that preserve privacy.

576
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,810
One is ring signatures.

577
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:37,370
In ring signatures,

578
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:44,170
the sender of funds is lined up along with 10 other senders of funds

579
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:50,670
and the only thing that you know happened in that transaction is one out of those 11 people sent money.

580
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:53,070
It's as if every time you spend money,

581
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:57,870
now you have 10 friends or 10 random people, 10 decoys

582
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:02,250
and all that you know, cryptographically, is one of the 11 have sent the money.

583
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:04,490
That protects the sender's identity.

584
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:06,150
How about the receivers identity?

585
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:12,270
Well, the receiver's Monero account does not appear unencrypted on the Monero blockchain.

586
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:17,390
A one-time-use address is what gets put on the blockchain

587
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:20,310
so that protects the recipients' privacy.

588
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:23,350
How about the amount that gets sent? Because there are

589
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:26,210
attacks that can be done by knowing,

590
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:30,830
kind of observing your pattern of how much you spend.

591
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:34,490
That is covered with technology, RingCT,

592
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:39,870
which originally was developed for Bitcoin but actually first got implemented in Monero.

593
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:43,810
RingCT stands for confidential transactions.

594
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:48,550
And all these things (are) combined to make Monero's fungibility.

595
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,230
The end result is that in Monero,

596
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:55,230
coins are indistinguishable from their another or they have no memory.

597
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:57,050
They have no memory of where they've been,

598
00:33:57,050 --> 00:34:00,730
which is really what you want in a money because the opposite,

599
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:04,690
if you have money that has perfect memory, like it is in Bitcoin,

600
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:13,170
that unfortunately gets used to falsely associate activities of people who had nothing to do with each other.

601
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:18,930
Because Monero is fungible, users benefit by having privacy.

602
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:22,750
The Monero blockchain is public just like Bitcoin.

603
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:26,170
There is a publicly shared ledger

604
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:30,070
of who sent what to who that everybody in the world can get.

605
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:33,870
All you have to do is download the Monero software and you too

606
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:39,390
can have a copy of this ledger, of that has the complete history of who sent what to who.

607
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:41,730
The difference is that, in Monero,

608
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:46,030
the details of this blockchain are encrypted

609
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:50,290
so that if you just look at it, you see encrypted garbage.

610
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:52,930
You cannot do what you can do in Bitcoin which is

611
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:58,430
type in somebody's Bitcoin address and immediately see how much money they have.

612
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:02,130
I represent high net worth clients, institutional investors --

613
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:05,530
and for them this kind of feature is a showstopper.

614
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:10,610
Nobody with wealth wants anyone in the world to type in

615
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:14,650
their bank account and see instantly how much money they have.

616
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:19,050
Or see instantly whenever they transfer money out or get money in

617
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,750
as you can do in the Bitcoin blockchain.

618
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:24,830
You can set a little automated robot to like,

619
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:29,270
watch the blockchain for you and send you an alert on your cellphone

620
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:35,330
whenever a transaction goes in and out of any Bitcoin address that you choose.

621
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:38,770
This sort of kind of casual surveillance,

622
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:41,270
this invitation to be creepy on your neighbor

623
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:45,850
is something that is intrinsically part of Bitcoin.

624
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,410
And the deeper (it) gets into society,

625
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:50,270
the more insidious it is,

626
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:55,250
the more of a threat it is to all of our privacy.

627
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:58,770
A slander that happens is that

628
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:02,170
"okay, so you have this money that doesn't have a history,

629
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:05,850
sounds like only the criminals are going to want to use it".

630
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:10,910
It is a slander I'm kind of tired of hearing.

631
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:14,690
Monero benefits people who have nothing to hide.

632
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:16,350
The chief benefit is that

633
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:18,790
with the money that has no memory,

634
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:22,670
there's no need to worry about being falsely accused of misdeeds due

635
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:27,810
to being one hop away from a "bad person".

636
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:31,550
Basically, when you accept a surveillance coin,

637
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:37,030
you are accepting the risk that somebody unsavory will be sending you something.

638
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:40,430
For example, let's say you have a business you sell stickers or

639
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:43,670
t-shirts or something very innocent

640
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:47,570
and you decide that you're going to accept Bitcoin for your business.

641
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:51,490
Unbeknownst to you, you get a t-shirt order from a gangster

642
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:54,990
or some drug dealer or someone like that.

643
00:36:54,990 --> 00:37:00,270
You had no idea they're a drug dealer, they're just sending you some Bitcoin because you're a t-shirt seller

644
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:01,850
and this is how you make money --

645
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:03,770
you need to get money from people.

646
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:09,910
But because the people watching the blockchain and putting faces and names

647
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:12,950
on addresses on blockchain, don't know that --

648
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:15,050
they can try to program that in,

649
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:18,790
but in the end, it's a probabilistic assessment of

650
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:21,370
is this bad person really related to you.

651
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:26,650
The only way that somebody finds out that they've been bitten by this is that

652
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:31,830
"oh, geez, Coinbase just emailed me and my account's been closed."

653
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:36,130
"Even the Fiat bank that I had associated with my crypto exchange"

654
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:38,590
"now thinks that there's something suspicious about me."

655
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:42,330
"Now my Fiat bank has frozen my funds for some reason" --

656
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:46,470
and it had nothing to do with anything that the person in question did.

657
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:49,570
It's just that the money itself has this

658
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:54,910
fatal flaw of being totally, (of) having a history behind it.

659
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:56,610
It's not really money,

660
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,950
it's like beanie babies, it's like collectables.

661
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:03,790
It's like collectible items with their own serial number that are getting passed around in this economy,

662
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:06,490
it's not a real money.

663
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:12,190
I want to leave with a Nobel Prize winning idea.

664
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,350
I find that not too many people have heard of this paper.

665
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:21,030
George Akerlof won the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on asymmetric information in markets.

666
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:24,150
Anyone here know this paper well?

667
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:26,170
Okay. Great.

668
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:28,690
I'll explain it briefly.

669
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:31,170
There are two kinds of used cars.

670
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:35,170
There are lemons, which are the bad used cars.

671
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:40,350
Those are... you buy them and then they break immediately - those are lemons.

672
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:44,010
The other kind of used car is a peach - these are the good cars.

673
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:46,990
Those owners of the peaches, they did all the maintenance.

674
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:52,350
They change the oil, they did all the work to make sure that they have a nice car to sell.

675
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:57,330
Sellers know whether they're selling a lemon or a peach.

676
00:38:57,330 --> 00:39:00,650
The seller knows that. If you're selling a lemon, you know it.

677
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:03,210
And you're just trying to make money off the selling of the lemon.

678
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:07,370
If you have a peach, you know it because you've been doing maintenance on that car.

679
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:10,730
However, the buyer of the car is ignorant

680
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:19,250
because both lemon sellers and peach sellers make extra sure that the paint job on the car is extra shiny.

681
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:22,370
The cars all look alike to the buyer

682
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:25,750
so the buyer knows that they are vulnerable in this situation.

683
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:29,790
The buyer knows that they could end up with a lemon.

684
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:34,050
Because the buyer is ignorant but not totally ignorant.

685
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:37,550
They are actually aware of their own ignorance.

686
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:44,830
(And) because of that, the buyer then adjusts their offer price to be slightly lower than that of a peach.

687
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:50,450
The asking, offer price for the car is going to be not quite at the peach price here.

688
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:53,230
It's going to be slightly lower.

689
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:55,010
What happens then?

690
00:39:55,010 --> 00:40:01,130
If you're selling a lemon and you see this pretty high price being offered for cars, you're happy.

691
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:07,510
Because your lemon, which is worth this low price, can sell for this.

692
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:09,530
So the lemon sellers are happy.

693
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:13,630
There are more suckers out there to buy their lemons.

694
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:18,670
How about the peach sellers? The peach sellers are the ones who did the work to have a good car to sell

695
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:23,030
and now they're seeing this offer price which is less than the peach price.

696
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:27,010
They're discouraged and slightly offended

697
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:32,370
because all that work they did, all the good work that they did to keep that car good.

698
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:35,310
And they followed all the rules with their car.

699
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:42,470
That good behavior is not getting rewarded in the form of a high price coming from the buyer.

700
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:46,490
So the peach sellers get discouraged, they leave the market.

701
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:49,710
What happens is that peach sellers leave.

702
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:52,350
Well, now the buyers figure out that

703
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:55,230
their chance of buying a lemon has just gone up

704
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:57,650
and the price that they're going to offer goes down.

705
00:40:57,650 --> 00:41:02,690
And you have this race to the bottom in which the offer price keeps going down, down, down.

706
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:04,870
All of the good sellers leave the market

707
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:10,930
because they are not being justly compensated for the work that they've done.

708
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:14,090
What does it have to do the cryptocurrency?

709
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:16,410
Surveillance coins

710
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:21,450
which have a total record and a total history of who had them

711
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:24,710
are the used cars of cryptocurrency.

712
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:30,150
Whenever you buy Bitcoin from somebody and you don't know the history of that Bitcoin,

713
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:33,150
you are the used car buyer in this situation.

714
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:35,530
You don't know if you accept this Bitcoin...

715
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:41,950
"Am I going to be just fine or am I going to be falsely accused of some who knows what?"

716
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:47,890
Who knows what possible crime could have been done with the person who used to own that Bitcoin.

717
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:49,870
You don't know if that's going to happen to you.

718
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:57,430
As a Bitcoin receiver, you are in the position of the used car buyer.

719
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:02,350
What in this paper is identified as

720
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:07,150
a means to avoid this race to the bottom -- is a signal.

721
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:10,310
So in the car market, for example --

722
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:12,810
and there's probably something similar to this in Europe,

723
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:16,190
where you can type in the serial number, the VIN number of a car

724
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:18,410
and then you get a report...

725
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:20,550
you can see if it's been in an accident... --

726
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:23,350
this doesn't exist in Europe? Okay, well.

727
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:25,650
Business idea for somebody...

728
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:28,570
It exists in the United States. It's called Carfax

729
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:33,450
and you type in the serial number of a car and all of its kind of past history comes up.

730
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:39,110
That information can equalize the playing field between the buyers and the sellers of cars.

731
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:41,230
This also happens in the job market.

732
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:43,950
Education is a similar situation.

733
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:48,890
If you are a boss, you're hiring a worker... you have a hundred workers out there applying for jobs.

734
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:50,970
They all look the same to you because it's like

735
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:52,530
everyone starts looking the same.

736
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:55,190
All the resumes look the same after a while.

737
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:59,730
So how are the sellers of their labor going to distinguish themselves?

738
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:01,370
They're going to have a signal.

739
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:07,230
Education is a signal just like information in the used car market is.

740
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:11,930
Basically, the sellers of labor take it upon themselves to get

741
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:17,150
educational credential to signal to the buyer of labor

742
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:20,510
that their labor is going to be worth more.

743
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:24,850
Unfortunately, what happens is that the sellers of education then figure this out

744
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:27,030
and then they just start selling education

745
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:31,470
because they know that the people coming for the education are just going

746
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:33,530
to get an employment signal.

747
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:37,750
The actual purpose of the education gets lost.

748
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:41,670
This is happening in non-fungible cryptocurrencies as well.

749
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:45,350
Right now, anybody who signs up for an account

750
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:46,950
at a centralized exchange

751
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:50,690
has to do all sorts of degrading things.

752
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:52,850
You have to hold up a picture of your ID,

753
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:56,730
you have to make a little handwritten note that says this "this is my name".

754
00:43:56,730 --> 00:44:01,210
You have to basically submit all this stuff just to be deemed worthy enough

755
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:04,990
to participate in this cryptocurrency economy.

756
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:07,950
That is a signal in this sense too.

757
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:10,930
But what's interesting is that in cryptocurrency,

758
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:17,350
currently, the exchanges bear the burden of due diligence on their customers.

759
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:22,110
It's an expense for the exchanges to be doing, to check all these people out.

760
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:26,710
It could be that in the future that just like in the education market and in the car market.

761
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:31,050
It's the seller who's going to have to increasingly go through hoops

762
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:36,090
basically to prove their worthiness in this whole system.

763
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:39,730
Just to take a step back,

764
00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:42,130
I've gone over scarcity in Bitcoin and Monero

765
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:45,610
and I've gone over fungibility and privacy in Bitcoin and Monero.

766
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:46,970
And if we step back,

767
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:51,990
I can identify what I think is a reason why crypto is not going to go away --

768
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:54,410
why it's here to stay.

769
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:56,390
Now we have the internet,

770
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:59,570
we have mobile telecommunication --

771
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:03,630
everybody here has at least one device

772
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:07,110
that is extremely good at copying packets.

773
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:10,590
That's what cellphones are. They are just packet copiers.

774
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:12,390
When you fetch your email,

775
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:17,030
you are copying packets from the email server to your phone to check.

776
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:23,470
We've become just extraordinarily efficient at copying ones and zeros globally.

777
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:27,370
The marginal cost of shuttling these bits around is zero.

778
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:29,810
What is rare in that world,

779
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:33,850
what is rare in a world where every human on earth basically

780
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:39,610
has the ability to copy ones and zeros anywhere around the world for free?

781
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:42,970
Well, it's going to be digital scarcity

782
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:44,390
and digital privacy.

783
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:46,710
Digital scarcity in the sense that

784
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:50,030
there's a sequence of ones and zeros that only you know

785
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:52,910
which is cryptocurrency - that's the private key.

786
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:54,890
And privacy in which you

787
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:57,530
have a sequence of ones and zeros also you only know

788
00:45:57,530 --> 00:45:59,610
and that you haven't shared with everyone

789
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:03,950
like you've shared the contents of your lunch on Facebook with the entire world

790
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:09,310
and other details of your life that are basically copied around.

791
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:12,890
These are the two things that are going to be scarce in the future:

792
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:16,330
digital scarcity and digital privacy.

793
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:18,590
Cryptocurrencies offer both.

794
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:20,670
And cryptocurrencies like Monero

795
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:24,890
especially offer both because they offer privacy as well.

796
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:27,710
Next I want to talk about community.

797
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:31,790
In the past when we've had Fiat money,

798
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:34,890
basically, your nationality

799
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:39,370
told you what community you belong to for purposes of money.

800
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:42,610
If you're born in the Eurozone, well, you use Euros.

801
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:45,730
I was born American, so I use the US dollar.

802
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:48,250
That kind of gets told to you at birth

803
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:50,850
as an accident of where you were born.

804
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,210
Now with cryptocurrencies,

805
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:59,650
because the system of bookkeeping is a decentralized network of computers that can be worldwide

806
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:03,650
this idea of association is now fluid.

807
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:09,970
It's more open, it's really like the Reformation of the Church.

808
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:13,930
Another famous German, Martin Luther

809
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:18,830
who liberated theology from the kind of

810
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:21,050
centralized control of the Catholic Church

811
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:26,130
and liberated this ability for people to elect

812
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:29,370
to worship in the way that they chose.

813
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:35,230
A similar sort of thing is now possible, because of Nakamoto consensus,

814
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:38,710
almost 11 years and a month old.

815
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:43,490
Now it's possible for each one of us to kind of pick a group,

816
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:45,710
"pick your own church," pick your own...

817
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:47,310
like, that's not really quite right

818
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:48,310
but I think you get what I'm saying.

819
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:52,350
You can pick your own group of people who agree

820
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:56,650
on certain characteristics that they want their money to have

821
00:47:56,650 --> 00:48:00,990
and you are free to associate with each of those groups.

822
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:05,590
Bitcoin is one such group that apparently doesn't

823
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:08,950
really, is not too bothered by the fact that

824
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:14,270
the currency has this perfect knowledge of history for every single coin that's out there.

825
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:20,410
And that is a large association of people all of whom have the shared belief

826
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:26,190
that the token that they are keeping track of on their blockchain is money

827
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:29,090
and there's a similar sort of community,

828
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:34,290
sort of formation that happens with the cryptocurrencies.

829
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:38,150
I'd like to share some of my observations about the Monero community

830
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:41,910
and by the way, I'm volunteering to be here.

831
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:44,930
I've paid my own dime to come out here from Boston

832
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:49,470
to kind of share what I think

833
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:53,290
my understanding of the current status of cryptocurrencies with you.

834
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:56,770
Monero is basically, it's run like a charity.

835
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:58,570
There is no company behind it.

836
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:04,230
There's no pre-mine, there's no scammy way for people to get rich.

837
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:09,290
All of the Monero in existence were given in the past to a miner

838
00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:13,750
who was doing the accounting work to help support the network, just like in Bitcoin.

839
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:16,790
Both Bitcoin and Monero have the positive aspect that there's

840
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:21,530
no central company steering things to kind of make a profit.

841
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:25,550
No, it's totally open-source grassroots.

842
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:30,550
Just normal everyday people choosing to run some

843
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,650
peer-to-peer network software on their computer

844
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:37,390
and join this community who have this shared

845
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:41,330
ethos in what they think that money should be.

846
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:47,850
The Monero community, I find it to be idealistic scientific and yet very welcoming.

847
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:50,010
It's very chill.

848
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:54,970
There's like a lot of alpha geek happening in some other coins,

849
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:58,950
in which people are just really out there on Twitter

850
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:03,470
and they just really want everyone to know that they're the "alpha-est" geek out there.

851
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:06,110
That kind of thing is refreshingly absent in Monero.

852
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:07,410
It's very chill.

853
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:11,250
It's one thing that kind of I like about this whole vibe here at c3.

854
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:14,290
It's very chill, there's just like a lot of people lounging

855
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:18,610
and that sort of shared relaxed atmosphere is something that I've

856
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:22,290
personally observed at the Monero meetups that I've been to.

857
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:25,670
Monero Research Lab - we have full-time PhDs

858
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:29,450
who do nothing but cryptographic research.

859
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:32,150
There's sort of a pipeline of research in which

860
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:34,930
pure science gets done at Monero Research Lab.

861
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:38,090
Then, implementations of the promising idea get tested out

862
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:43,750
then there's an audit process that we actually employ --

863
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:47,130
external auditors to look at implementations of code.

864
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:51,710
Once those are clean, then we go to release.

865
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:56,530
There's this basically pipeline of technology from science to engineering

866
00:50:56,530 --> 00:51:00,070
that gets pushed out in the actual release of the Monero

867
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:02,530
core software.

868
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:08,030
The LMDB database is another kind of interesting example of how far Monero has come.

869
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:09,810
In the early days of Monero,

870
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:13,190
the entire blockchain was stored in RAM

871
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:14,690
if you can believe that.

872
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:19,550
So, that kind of puts a hard limit on how big your blockchain can be

873
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:21,290
if it has to fit in RAM.

874
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:26,210
The LMDB block database - which was the brainchild of Howard Chu

875
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:29,450
who is one of the very frequent contributors

876
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:37,570
and sort of an open-source Linux guru - was added to Monero.

877
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:40,990
Monero is actually number three in terms of developer effort

878
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:47,090
if you look at the... if you rank the coins not by market cap but by actual developer effort.

879
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:49,610
It goes Bitcoin, Ethereum and then Monero.

880
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:51,570
It turns out that,

881
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:53,010
well, in my opinion,

882
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:56,470
the killer app of Nakamoto consensus is money

883
00:51:56,470 --> 00:52:01,930
because you have a ledger of scarcity that's being shared.

884
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:05,350
And what's a more natural thing is there for

885
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:08,930
a shared idea of scarcity, then money?

886
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:12,550
But it turns out that money is non-trivial to get right.

887
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:14,370
It needs to be thought through.

888
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:19,410
These things like... should the money have a complete history behind it

889
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:22,350
or should it be fungible?

890
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:24,250
Like that kind of basic idea that

891
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:28,250
basic engineering design decision has to be made early on

892
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:34,130
because the technology that's needed to bake in fungibility to Monero -- it's highly non-trivial.

893
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:36,750
Monero has been added for 6 years now

894
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:38,890
and has made great improvements in that.

895
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:42,510
And the way that the social contract is,

896
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:47,030
I just can't see this happening in Bitcoin.

897
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:50,270
There are volunteer workgroups for community outreach

898
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:52,010
and, as I said before,

899
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:59,550
all of the funding to support all of this is completely 100% shaking the tin cup

900
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:02,990
and asking for people to donate out of the kindness of their hearts.

901
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:06,150
And the people in the Monero community do that.

902
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:08,170
They actually step up to the plate

903
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:10,510
and they fulfill these.

904
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:13,230
But if you look at the annual budget --

905
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:16,150
if Monero were a company, which it's not --

906
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:19,710
but if Monero were a company and you looked at its operating budget,

907
00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:24,290
you would be astounded at how minuscule, how tiny it is.

908
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:27,550
And that's because you have idealistic, passionate people

909
00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:31,610
working on this project in true open-source spirit,

910
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:34,410
often on their spare time.

911
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:37,820
All right.

912
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:42,190
So, just to summarize,

913
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:47,290
Monero is what Bitcoin newbs think they bought.

914
00:53:48,430 --> 00:53:51,090
I'm going to switch hats a little bit.

915
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:54,830
As I mentioned, one of my jobs before going full time in crypto --

916
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:57,230
I was head of research at a hedge fund

917
00:53:57,230 --> 00:54:02,610
and the question of thinking of cryptocurrency as an investment comes up.

918
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:07,190
And of course because there have been these spectacular gains in the price of Bitcoin,

919
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:08,970
it gets discussed a lot.

920
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:14,010
One thing that is positive about Monero's culture is that it is generally

921
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:17,390
gauche to talk about prices,

922
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:21,470
and returns, and the price going to the moon.

923
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:24,110
I hope that, well --

924
00:54:24,110 --> 00:54:28,070
I have some background in academic finance;

925
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:32,270
there's a paper that I co-authored on the effect of liquidity on asset prices

926
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:36,830
that won a "paper of the year" award in applied finance;

927
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:40,590
and that, coupled with the Nobel Prize that I just explained --

928
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:46,950
hopefully, I can put a respectable enough academic sheen on the discussion of

929
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:53,650
the finance and economics to be forgivable by the Monero community.

930
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:57,350
But the fact is that this project is going to attract investors,

931
00:54:57,350 --> 00:54:59,050
it's going to attract <i>hodlers</i>.

932
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:01,250
It's a socioeconomic hedge.

933
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:04,090
There are lots of investment, there are lots of ETFs out there.

934
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:08,490
If you believe that companies should be environmentally sustainable

935
00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:12,150
and that their corporate boards should have official policies that

936
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:16,250
mandate sustainability in one sense or another,

937
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:20,350
there are ETFs that will only invest in those companies.

938
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:23,850
It's possible to be basically an ideological investor

939
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:26,290
if you really care about sustainability

940
00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:30,490
and there's an investment for you.

941
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:33,750
If, for example, like say Islamic finance --

942
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:37,910
they are not cool with the idea of interest being paid on loans,

943
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:41,890
so you have another subset of Islamic finance investments

944
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:45,410
that don't involve paying interest on loans.

945
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:51,890
Monero - if you look at it in a similar lens - is basically an ideal hedge

946
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:54,710
for people who have two characteristics.

947
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:58,570
One is that they're concerned about mismanagement and corruption

948
00:55:58,570 --> 00:56:02,210
on the part of central banks managing Fiat

949
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:08,370
and two, they're gravely disturbed by the state of surveillance capitalism

950
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:13,150
in which everything about all of us is recorded all the time

951
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:15,910
and will stay forever,

952
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:20,350
and we have little or no control over that.

953
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:22,950
It's done in the name of security

954
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:26,950
but unfortunately, if you push that line too far,

955
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:30,290
you cease to become an open and free society.

956
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:37,270
There are reasons that we, in the West, have put limits on the powers of government

957
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:43,750
and that is because of an awareness of what happens when there are no limits on the powers of government.

958
00:56:44,310 --> 00:56:46,710
A project like Monero is a hedge --

959
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:51,230
it's basically a "put your money where your mouth is" kind of thing

960
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:55,030
for people who have strong feelings on those two points --

961
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:57,990
it's just going to attract investors.

962
00:56:57,990 --> 00:57:03,670
Gresham's law is an economic concept that the best form of money gets hoarded.

963
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,910
People keep the best kind of money

964
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:09,750
and the inferior form of money, they're going to use that to spend.

965
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:13,130
But the good stuff, they're going to keep for themselves. That's Gresham's law.

966
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:15,450
So with Monero, this tends to happen.

967
00:57:15,450 --> 00:57:18,190
A lot of people in Monero used to be in Bitcoin,

968
00:57:18,190 --> 00:57:20,830
but now, whenever they deal with Bitcoin,

969
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:27,430
they find their heads consumed with all these worries about traceability

970
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:30,390
and so on.

971
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:32,070
It's refreshing to come to Monero

972
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:33,330
where you don't have to worry about that

973
00:57:33,330 --> 00:57:35,430
because the currency is actually fungible.

974
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:38,650
And because it's fungible, it becomes a superior form of money

975
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:41,030
that gets hoarded by Gresham's law.

976
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:46,050
That's another tendency that's going to happen to people:  to want to keep the Monero

977
00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:48,230
and spend the other stuff.

978
00:57:48,310 --> 00:57:50,230
Also, capital gains taxes:

979
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:52,790
at least in America, and I believe in Germany too,

980
00:57:52,790 --> 00:57:57,090
if you hold an asset for over a year in Germany, you don't have to pay gains on it.

981
00:57:57,090 --> 00:57:59,930
That's what I've read. Is that right in Germany?  (nods)

982
00:58:00,370 --> 00:58:03,250
Basically, the tax law

983
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:07,790
promotes looking at those cryptocurrency projects that are solid

984
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:10,750
and have a real reason to exist

985
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:14,170
and so that is also going to attract investment money to Monero.

986
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:20,190
The question is: can these new investors integrate into the community?

987
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:23,450
Part of what I do as a consultant is I try to bridge these worlds.

988
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:27,150
I try to take these new investors

989
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:32,310
whose inclination might be to want to talk to the "manager of Monero"

990
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:35,310
and have a word with them about the release schedule.

991
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:37,590
And they want this, and this and this feature

992
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:39,590
built into the next release --

993
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:41,230
basically, this whole mentality of

994
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:46,310
"I own some tokens therefore I'm your customer and you have to do what I say"

995
00:58:46,310 --> 00:58:50,550
which of course falls completely flat on its face in any open-source project

996
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:53,650
as that's not how changes happen in Linux.

997
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:56,130
Nobody goes to Linus and demands,

998
00:58:56,130 --> 00:59:00,810
makes ultimatums on what they want to see in the next rollout.

999
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:03,470
Basically, one thing that I'm doing is

1000
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:06,730
trying to bridge these worlds of the traditional investment world

1001
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:10,450
and that of the OG, cryptocurrency open-source world

1002
00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:12,450
that's surrounding us here.

1003
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:13,770
Community investors,

1004
00:59:13,770 --> 00:59:16,930
I posit are kind of a subset of investors that

1005
00:59:16,930 --> 00:59:21,530
can be valued members of the community.  Instead of being

1006
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:23,690
entitled and thinking that they're customers,

1007
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:27,230
they'll take the attitude that they're helping to bear financial risk

1008
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,130
on behalf of the project.

1009
00:59:29,410 --> 00:59:33,270
They will do things like take self-custody of their coins

1010
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:36,710
and not just leave them on exchange - which lots of people do.

1011
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:39,450
Lots of people leave their crypto on exchanges

1012
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:41,990
then the exchange gets hacked, they lose their money.

1013
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:44,630
The reality is: if the money is on the exchange,

1014
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:46,930
you don't own the private key and it's not your crypto.

1015
00:59:46,930 --> 00:59:49,430
It's actually an IOU that you own for crypto,

1016
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:51,850
it's not crypto that you own

1017
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:59,090
and there's a kind of a list of aspects that I think are proper for

1018
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:06,670
a community type of investor to be a solid member of the Monero community.

1019
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:10,910
One thing to do, also, is to make sure that

1020
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:16,150
there are proper legal structures around one's ownership of cryptocurrency.

1021
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:24,470
One of the subsets of the traditional finance world that I help to bridge with cryptocurrencies is that of trusts.

1022
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:28,070
In a statutory law kind of regime like Germany,

1023
01:00:28,070 --> 01:00:30,330
the whole concept of trust might be a little foreign

1024
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:32,490
because it comes from English common law.

1025
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:36,390
But the idea is that a trust is a legal entity,

1026
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:37,370
it's a legal thing.

1027
01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:38,930
It's kind of a company

1028
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:42,510
but it's a different category of legal structure.

1029
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:44,910
A trust is a

1030
01:00:44,910 --> 01:00:48,690
kind of a holding vessel for funds that

1031
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:53,890
a giver wants to give to beneficiaries but not immediately.

1032
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:55,870
Basically, there are three people involved.

1033
01:00:55,870 --> 01:01:00,310
There's a grantor who has wealth and wants to transfer it to the beneficiaries

1034
01:01:00,310 --> 01:01:03,830
but not just outright, they want the money to go into a trust.

1035
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:07,290
The grantor will work to make the rules of the trust

1036
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:10,670
and then transfer property into the trust

1037
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:13,170
as part of the document that defines the trust,

1038
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:17,450
you have a list of beneficiaries who could ultimately benefit from the property

1039
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:20,190
and then you have a third party which is the trustee.

1040
01:01:20,190 --> 01:01:24,430
The trustee is the legal owner of the assets that are given into trust

1041
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:27,710
but the legal owner is with conditions.

1042
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:30,530
The legal owner cannot do whatever they want with the property,

1043
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:35,110
they have to follow the instructions that are in the trust document.

1044
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:40,530
In effect, this is what crypto people would think of as a smart contract.

1045
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:44,770
It's kind of the original old-school legal contract

1046
01:01:44,770 --> 01:01:50,090
and if you're careful with

1047
01:01:50,090 --> 01:01:54,270
which jurisdictions you place the various players in the trust,

1048
01:01:54,270 --> 01:01:57,510
there are advantages that can be had --

1049
01:01:57,510 --> 01:02:00,330
which are very dependent on jurisdiction,

1050
01:02:00,330 --> 01:02:04,350
and it's just completely impossible for me to spell it out

1051
01:02:04,350 --> 01:02:06,110
because of the complexity of this --

1052
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:10,710
but possible benefits are legal tax reduction,

1053
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:12,790
protection from being sued.

1054
01:02:12,790 --> 01:02:16,350
In other words, if money is in a trust,

1055
01:02:16,350 --> 01:02:19,870
it's not the giver's money anymore,

1056
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:22,970
it's not the wealth owner's money anymore, it's the trus't money.

1057
01:02:22,970 --> 01:02:26,830
If somebody sues the wealth owner, the wealth is gone.

1058
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:29,290
It's not theirs anymore, it belongs the trust.

1059
01:02:29,290 --> 01:02:34,290
And then there are trust laws that protect that money from lawsuits as well.

1060
01:02:34,930 --> 01:02:38,210
Most people think "well, you know, I'm at low risk.

1061
01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:42,230
I'm a nice guy I don't hurt anybody, nobody's going to sue me".

1062
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:46,230
But one glaring exception to this is divorce.

1063
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:53,410
People routinely get robbed by people who they only recently married

1064
01:02:53,410 --> 01:02:57,730
and it turns out that irrevocable trusts made before marriage --

1065
01:02:57,730 --> 01:03:00,190
you have to do it before or otherwise it won't count --

1066
01:03:00,190 --> 01:03:06,210
but it's one of the only things that can survive a challenge.

1067
01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:09,190
Also, legal enhanced privacy

1068
01:03:09,190 --> 01:03:12,330
so depending on the jurisdiction in which you place the trust,

1069
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:18,550
you could benefit from enhanced privacy protecting those assets.

1070
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:21,890
Actually, relevant to people who are not Americans,

1071
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:24,350
you may or may not be aware of this,

1072
01:03:24,350 --> 01:03:29,130
but there's a saying within estate planning and wealth management

1073
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:32,010
that "America is the new Switzerland."

1074
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:37,030
And this is because America has laws that are asymmetric.

1075
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:40,970
America has a law called FATCA, which was put in by Obama,

1076
01:03:40,970 --> 01:03:49,110
which requires worldwide financial institutions to send data on Americans back to the IRS.

1077
01:03:49,110 --> 01:03:52,950
This is why it's almost impossible for an American to get a German bank account

1078
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:55,790
because the German bank account

1079
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:59,670
will have a whole bunch of burdensome reporting requirements

1080
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:03,390
to the IRS to take on this American customer.

1081
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:05,450
That's why Americans have a lot of trouble

1082
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:09,110
when they go overseas to work.

1083
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:13,910
In reaction to this, the other countries of the world came up with what's called CRS

1084
01:04:13,910 --> 01:04:16,070
which is the "Common Reporting Standard."

1085
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:19,830
The idea is the same, for example:

1086
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:22,950
one European government wants to make sure that

1087
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:27,190
its citizens are not trying to hide money in Australia,

1088
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:30,630
so they sign this like agreement

1089
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:34,190
for all these countries to share financial information with each other

1090
01:04:34,190 --> 01:04:37,510
to make sure that nobody's cheating on their taxes.

1091
01:04:37,770 --> 01:04:41,370
There's basically a bunch of countries that have signed on to this CRS

1092
01:04:41,370 --> 01:04:44,210
but America is not one of them.

1093
01:04:44,730 --> 01:04:46,550
Thus lies the asymmetry

1094
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:53,170
that for US citizens who doing affairs abroad,

1095
01:04:53,170 --> 01:04:55,170
like legitimate businesses abroad,

1096
01:04:55,170 --> 01:04:58,010
all of that information gets sent back to the IRS.

1097
01:04:58,010 --> 01:05:03,570
But for a non-US person who sets up financial affairs in the US,

1098
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:08,330
there is no obligation for the US to send the information back to the home country.

1099
01:05:08,550 --> 01:05:13,510
So, thus the saying, "America is the new Switzerland."

1100
01:05:15,630 --> 01:05:17,530
My reason for going into all that

1101
01:05:17,530 --> 01:05:22,470
is that Monero is a project that is important for humanity

1102
01:05:22,470 --> 01:05:28,950
and I think that for people who are in custody of Monero,

1103
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:31,110
it's an important job for them

1104
01:05:31,110 --> 01:05:33,750
to basically sort this stuff out.

1105
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:37,230
Figure out what's going to happen when you die

1106
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:40,750
and ideally, figure that stuff out,

1107
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:42,290
maybe make a trust

1108
01:05:42,290 --> 01:05:45,550
that kind of executes all these things while you're alive --

1109
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:49,890
then you have more control over it while you're alive than when you're dead.

1110
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:55,250
Basically, that's going to avoid this kind of situation where a lawsuit causes

1111
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:58,910
Monero to be handed over, liquidated,

1112
01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:01,190
basically, things that are not good for the network --

1113
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:07,930
this stuff needs to be kind of held and taken care of.

1114
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:12,590
I am over time.  So unfortunately,

1115
01:06:12,590 --> 01:06:18,670
the section that I had on asset correlations is...

1116
01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:23,550
I'm just going to maybe show one slide.

1117
01:06:24,870 --> 01:06:27,330
This is kind of a complicated one but

1118
01:06:27,330 --> 01:06:33,010
this is showing the degree to which the monthly ups and downs of Monero

1119
01:06:33,010 --> 01:06:35,910
versus the monthly ups and downs of Bitcoin

1120
01:06:35,910 --> 01:06:39,590
versus the monthly ups and downs of the US stock market,

1121
01:06:39,590 --> 01:06:42,690
the US bond market and gold.

1122
01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:46,810
For example, this square here

1123
01:06:46,810 --> 01:06:50,130
is showing the intersection of Monero and Bitcoin.

1124
01:06:50,130 --> 01:06:53,530
On this axis you see the Monero return,

1125
01:06:53,530 --> 01:06:56,210
on this axis you see the Bitcoin return.

1126
01:06:56,210 --> 01:07:00,110
You can see that on months when Monero does well,

1127
01:07:00,110 --> 01:07:02,110
Bitcoin also tends to do well.

1128
01:07:02,110 --> 01:07:05,250
You have this kind of pattern, this correlation.

1129
01:07:06,030 --> 01:07:11,530
Here you can also see that there's some really extreme outlier months for Monero in the positive though.

1130
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:16,950
This particular month, Monero basically quadrupled in one month.

1131
01:07:17,470 --> 01:07:18,930
This is part of owning crypto --

1132
01:07:18,930 --> 01:07:22,390
that you're on this really wild rollercoaster ride --

1133
01:07:22,390 --> 01:07:25,590
and you need to kind of be able to deal with that.

1134
01:07:25,590 --> 01:07:27,130
But what this is showing is that

1135
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:30,890
there is a correlation between the returns of Monero and Bitcoin.

1136
01:07:30,890 --> 01:07:32,230
That's a .4 correlation.

1137
01:07:32,230 --> 01:07:35,270
A 1.00 correlation is perfectly correlated.

1138
01:07:35,270 --> 01:07:37,070
They go up and down together.

1139
01:07:37,070 --> 01:07:41,150
Negative 1 is the opposite. If one goes up, the other goes down.

1140
01:07:41,310 --> 01:07:43,210
In Modern Portfolio Theory --

1141
01:07:43,210 --> 01:07:47,110
and this is true for also your own personal portfolio, it's an idea to think about --

1142
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:52,250
if you have two assets who you expect to do well in the future

1143
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:56,410
and they're uncorrelated, in other words,

1144
01:07:56,410 --> 01:08:01,110
when one asset goes up the other is flat or maybe the other one goes down,

1145
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:06,510
in other words, the ups and downs from day to day of these two different assets

1146
01:08:06,510 --> 01:08:08,630
tend to cancel each other out.

1147
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:10,510
If you have that situation

1148
01:08:10,510 --> 01:08:14,170
then if you make a portfolio out of both of those assets

1149
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:17,890
your combined volatility is going to be improved.

1150
01:08:17,890 --> 01:08:19,510
It's going to be reduced

1151
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:24,590
because the components that you're adding are anti-correlated.

1152
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:27,710
This is a very big deal for Wall Street investors

1153
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:34,530
because it turns out correlation structure tends to be more dependable and long-lived

1154
01:08:34,530 --> 01:08:37,050
than predictions of outperformance, so

1155
01:08:37,050 --> 01:08:39,710
correlation structures tend to persist.

1156
01:08:40,590 --> 01:08:44,330
Wall Street is always looking for sources of uncorrelated alpha.

1157
01:08:44,610 --> 01:08:52,010
For example, if you look at the correlation of Monero with traditional assets like US stocks, we have 0.01.

1158
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:55,830
An idea to think about is that

1159
01:08:55,830 --> 01:09:00,150
putting together assets that wiggle in different ways can be

1160
01:09:00,150 --> 01:09:02,990
a positive force for your overall portfolio.

1161
01:09:02,990 --> 01:09:06,270
Now again, as I mentioned, this is only talking about correlation structure.

1162
01:09:06,270 --> 01:09:09,610
This is like the ups and downs. This is not talking about

1163
01:09:09,610 --> 01:09:11,590
"is the price going to go up in the future."

1164
01:09:11,590 --> 01:09:14,430
That's a different question.

1165
01:09:17,010 --> 01:09:19,310
Let me show this and then I'll finish.

1166
01:09:19,310 --> 01:09:24,230
I'm sorry, I'm going over -- but I guess there's no one after me --

1167
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:26,570
but I'll try to make it quick.

1168
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:32,890
I think what I'm showing here is pretty much the only asset price chart you need

1169
01:09:32,890 --> 01:09:35,050
and that is a very long term view.

1170
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:40,090
This is showing from the beginning of cryptocurrency, 2009 to 2020.

1171
01:09:40,090 --> 01:09:41,770
This is 11 years of history

1172
01:09:41,770 --> 01:09:46,610
and you almost never see this in the crypto bloggers

1173
01:09:46,610 --> 01:09:48,870
or people on YouTube blabbing about crypto.

1174
01:09:48,870 --> 01:09:51,770
They're always focused on what happened yesterday.

1175
01:09:53,350 --> 01:09:55,730
It's totally a distraction

1176
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:58,150
for anyone who has a long term view.

1177
01:09:59,190 --> 01:10:04,610
So, I would suggest whenever looking at crypto as an asset, to zoom out on the horizontal scale

1178
01:10:04,610 --> 01:10:06,910
and also zoom out on the vertical scale.

1179
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:12,930
What I'm showing here:  each of these [y axis] divisions is a factor of 10.

1180
01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:17,370
Here we have 1 cent, 1 dollar and 10 thousand dollars.

1181
01:10:17,450 --> 01:10:25,150
This is an initial investment of one euro becoming 10 million euros, that's the scale.

1182
01:10:25,150 --> 01:10:26,950
And on this sort of scale,

1183
01:10:26,950 --> 01:10:29,490
all of these ups and downs

1184
01:10:29,490 --> 01:10:32,530
which seem big, disappear.

1185
01:10:32,530 --> 01:10:35,250
For example, let's look at the S&P 500,

1186
01:10:35,250 --> 01:10:37,130
the US stock market.

1187
01:10:37,130 --> 01:10:39,070
If you're involved at all in the stock market,

1188
01:10:39,070 --> 01:10:43,390
you know that December 2019 has been a very good month.

1189
01:10:43,390 --> 01:10:45,890
We're talking 15% up

1190
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:48,230
which is really big for the stock market.

1191
01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:53,630
But if you look on this scale, it's like a pixel.

1192
01:10:56,850 --> 01:11:00,210
I think this underlines the decision

1193
01:11:00,210 --> 01:11:05,110
that anyone has when thinking about cryptocurrency as a possible investment.

1194
01:11:05,110 --> 01:11:08,350
It's this baby. It's still a baby.

1195
01:11:08,350 --> 01:11:12,370
It's amazing because it's gone up orders of magnitude

1196
01:11:12,370 --> 01:11:16,750
and yet compared to other assets, it's still a baby.

1197
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:18,430
This next chart shows that.

1198
01:11:18,430 --> 01:11:20,410
What I've done here is --

1199
01:11:20,410 --> 01:11:27,150
it's hard to understand if somebody tells you that the price of Bitcoin is $7,000.

1200
01:11:27,150 --> 01:11:32,330
It's hard to know whether that's high or low. Who knows?

1201
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:37,430
It's just really hard to know

1202
01:11:37,530 --> 01:11:39,790
because it's just one Bitcoin

1203
01:11:39,790 --> 01:11:41,790
and it's hard to put that in perspective.

1204
01:11:41,790 --> 01:11:43,790
What I've done here is I've taken the

1205
01:11:44,130 --> 01:11:48,010
value of all of the Bitcoin in existence.

1206
01:11:48,670 --> 01:11:53,270
Starting from the beginning of Bitcoin, as time goes on,

1207
01:11:53,270 --> 01:11:56,210
more Bitcoins got rewarded to miners

1208
01:11:56,210 --> 01:11:58,550
so there have been more Bitcoins in existence

1209
01:11:58,550 --> 01:12:01,110
and the price has been going up and down.

1210
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:04,470
I multiplied the number of Bitcoins in existence by the current price

1211
01:12:04,470 --> 01:12:06,750
and that gives you the market cap.

1212
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:09,630
What I've done with that is I've divided that

1213
01:12:09,630 --> 01:12:15,930
by the value of all of the gold, above ground, in the world.

1214
01:12:15,930 --> 01:12:19,510
All of the gold that has been already been dug out of the ground

1215
01:12:19,510 --> 01:12:22,110
and is sitting in vaults around the world

1216
01:12:22,110 --> 01:12:24,150
and owned mostly by central governments,

1217
01:12:24,150 --> 01:12:26,370
but also a good amount is in jewelry, and so on,

1218
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:28,370
and there are estimates of this.

1219
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:33,450
Basically, there are estimates for how much gold there is in the world at any given time

1220
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:36,670
so I've divided the value of all the world's Bitcoin

1221
01:12:36,670 --> 01:12:39,090
divided by the value of all the world's gold.

1222
01:12:39,090 --> 01:12:42,190
And I've done that for 11 years.

1223
01:12:42,190 --> 01:12:44,250
What you can see here is that,

1224
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:49,530
currently, the value of all the Bitcoin in the world is about 1% of that of all the gold.

1225
01:12:49,530 --> 01:12:53,770
In other words, all the gold is worth a hundred times what all the Bitcoin is worth.

1226
01:12:53,770 --> 01:12:56,470
And if you do that for Monero --

1227
01:12:56,470 --> 01:13:00,610
and, arguably, this analogy is even more apt for Monero,

1228
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:04,670
because when you turn a bar of gold over,

1229
01:13:04,670 --> 01:13:07,890
you don't see a list of everyone who owned that bar of gold,

1230
01:13:07,890 --> 01:13:09,130
you just see gold --

1231
01:13:09,450 --> 01:13:12,530
Monero acts more like actual gold than Bitcoin does,

1232
01:13:12,530 --> 01:13:16,490
therefore, it makes more sense to make a ratio of all the world's Monero,

1233
01:13:16,490 --> 01:13:17,670
how much is that worth --

1234
01:13:17,670 --> 01:13:20,250
divided by how much all the world's gold is worth

1235
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:25,650
if you do that, we're looking at 1/100 of 1%.

1236
01:13:26,690 --> 01:13:32,930
That's what I mean when I say that this asset class is still a baby, it's still early.

1237
01:13:33,050 --> 01:13:37,210
Things could go well for it, things could go very wrong for it.

1238
01:13:37,350 --> 01:13:39,790
There could be a bug that nobody knows about.

1239
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:42,690
There could be governmental action which a lot of people

1240
01:13:42,690 --> 01:13:44,050
I think overly worry about

1241
01:13:44,050 --> 01:13:50,190
because I think we geeks tend to think of governments as being like Reddit moderators

1242
01:13:50,190 --> 01:13:52,050
with ban power.

1243
01:13:52,050 --> 01:13:54,110
And that's not really how governments work,

1244
01:13:54,110 --> 01:13:56,110
it's a bit more deliberative --

1245
01:13:56,110 --> 01:14:00,110
and if an unjust ban happens, there are things like the Supreme Court

1246
01:14:00,110 --> 01:14:04,190
that might be asked to decide whether, for example,

1247
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:09,850
Americans have a fundamental right to transact value in a private manner.

1248
01:14:09,850 --> 01:14:14,630
This could be a court case that comes up in the future

1249
01:14:15,210 --> 01:14:16,290
put forth by people

1250
01:14:16,290 --> 01:14:20,190
who really care about privacy as a fundamental human right.

1251
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:24,440
I'll leave with that, and thanks for your attention.
